//Problem: It look gross in smaller browser widths and small devices
//Solution: To hide the text links and swap them out with a more appropriate navigation

//Create a select and append to menu
//Cycle over menu links
  // Create an option
  //Option's value is the href
  // option's text is the text of links
  // append option to select
//Create button 
  //Bind click to button 
  //go to select's location
// Modify CSS to hide links on small width and show button and select 
  // Also hides select and button on larger width and show's links
  // Deal with selected options depending on current page
