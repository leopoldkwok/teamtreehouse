Create a story-telling program:

1. Use the prompt() command several times to collect different types of words -- nouns, verbs, adjectives.
2. Store the result of each prompt() command in a different variable.
3. Combine the variables with other strings to create one or more non-sensical statements.
4. Print the resulting story to the browser using the document.write() command.
