// Problem: It looks gross in smaller browser widths and small devices
// Solution: to hide the text links and swap them out with a more appropriate navigation

// Create a select and append to menu
// Cycle over menu links
  // Create an option
  // option's value is the href
  // option's text is the text of a link
  // append option to select
// Create button
// Bind click to button
  // go to select's location
// Modify CSS to hide links on small width and show button and select
  // Also hides select and button on larger width and show's links
// Deal with selected options depending on current page
